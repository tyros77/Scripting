Collection of my scripts

## Powershell
* kerb_search.ps1 - A script I wrote to search through the security log of a Domain Controller to find TGS events to identify kerberos attacks
* seclog_parse.ps1 - This script searches through the security log of a Domain Controller, looking for specific event id's you specify.
